# Stroke Dataset Analysis with R-Shiny
Stroke is a type of cardiovascular disease, with two types: ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. It is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability globally. In 2016, 10.2% of total deaths were due to stroke. Approximately 15 million individuals worldwide experience a stroke each year, with 5 million deaths and 5 million permanent disabilities. Risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, tobacco use, diabetes, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol, kidney disease, and obesity.

This repository contains a Shiny project that analyzes the Stroke dataset. The project consists of three tabs that provide different functionalities:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: The first tab displays descriptive statistics of the Stroke dataset, providing insights into the variables and overall trends.

2. **Custom Visualizations**: The second tab allows users to create custom visualizations based on the Stroke dataset. This feature empowers users to explore relationships, patterns, trends visually and make inferences about them.

3. **Stroke Occurrence Prediction**: The third tab utilizes a generalized linear model (GLM) to predict stroke occurrence. Users can input relevant variables, and the model provides predictions and insights based on the dataset.

This project aims to provide an interactive and informative analysis of the Stroke dataset, enabling users to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. Feel free to explore the different tabs and interact with the visualizations and prediction model.

## Dataset

The Stroke dataset contains information about various factors that may contribute to stroke occurrence. It serves as the foundation for the analyses and predictions conducted in this project.

## Usage
