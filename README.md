# About this Shiny-Project
Stroke is a type of cardiovascular disease, with two types: ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. It is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability globally. In 2016, 10.2% of total deaths were due to stroke. Approximately 15 million individuals worldwide experience a stroke each year, with 5 million deaths and 5 million permanent disabilities. Risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, tobacco use, diabetes, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol, kidney disease, and obesity.

In this project, we have designed 3 tabs to provide users with a comprehensive analysis of the data set. The first tab presents the descriptive statistics of the data set, allowing users to navigate through the variables to get a summary of individuals with and without stroke. The second tab allows users to create visualizations based on the selected variables and make inferences about them. Lastly, the third tab enables users to predict stroke occurrence based on the generalized linear model .
